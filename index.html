              <p class="mine"> <strong>Welcome to my Program Portfolio! My name is Anna,</strong> I am lucky
                enough to reside in the beautiful State of Washington,
                and am currently attending programming classes in Seattle at
                a school known as <strong>Epicodus.</strong> This page is where all of my
                previous <em>and future</em> programming projects can be found.
                I am 24, and just developed a rather intense interest for
                coding over a very short period of time. After having no real
                knowledge about any of the "behind the scenes" work in computer
                programs, I found myself chatting with my father <em>(He works in the programming/coding feild himself) about the
                subject whilst I was trying to determine what path I might want
                to take in life, what career, what school, what interest? Intigued by the idea,
                and curious about what all went into this, I couldnt help but wonder, and I couldnt possibly write
                something off that I'd never experienced, I had to find out what it
                was all about! So that led me to a workshop run by Epicodus, and
                after that, it was settled. Completely enthralled by the problem
                solving and creative aspects, I managed to sign up for the classes
                Epicodus held, and started less than a week later. <span id="inspire">It's the
                threshold of an adventure into the world of web development,
                computer languages, frameworks, etc. and im eager to learn more
                 and hopefully write some amazing programs!</span></p>

              <h2 id="inspire">What Inspires me?</h2>
              <p class="spacing">You might be wondering; what drives me, why programming? Well to put it as short and sweetly as possible, I love the idea of a career where I am constantly having to use my mind to solve the issues at hand. Not to mention learning different subjects, languages, styles, and the chance to expand my knowledge with a rapidly changing enviroment. Until recently I'd never experienced any of the innerworkings of programs. However long discussions about the field, an Epicodus Workshop and then diving into the Epicodus classes, the possibility is beginning to take on a chance of reality. The idea of having to "unlearn to relearn" is starting to make more sense with every passing day, mental growth has always been something I've wanted more of, but due to personal issues over the last few years, I have been held back on pursuing. Now that I have the opportunity to change that, programming is turning into a subject I enjoy and could myself pursuing as a permanent career.<p>
