              <p class="mine"> <strong>Welcome to my Program Portfolio! My name is Anna,</strong> I am lucky
                enough to reside in the beautiful State of Washington,
                and am currently attending programming classes in Seattle at
                a school known as <strong>Epicodus.</strong> This page is where all of my
                previous <em>and future</em> programming projects can be found.
                I am 24, and just developed a rather intense interest for
                coding over a very short period of time. After having no real
                knowledge about any of the "behind the scenes" work in computer
                programs, I found myself chatting with my father <em>(He works in the programming/coding feild himself) about the
                subject whilst I was trying to determine what path I might want
                to take in life, what career, what school, what interest? Intigued by the idea,
                and curious about what all went into this, I couldnt help but wonder, and I couldnt possibly write
                something off that I'd never experienced, i had to find out what it
                was all about! So that led me to a workshop run by Epicodus, and
                after that, it was settled. Completely enthralled by the problem
                solving and creative aspects, I managed to sign up for the classes
                Epicodus held, and started less than a week later. It's the
                threshold of an adventure into the world of web development,
                computer languages, frameworks, etc. and im eager to learn more
                 and hopefully write some amazing programs!</p>
